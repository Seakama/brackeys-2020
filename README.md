# Brackeys 2020 2nd Jam
Repo for the Brackeys 2020 2nd game jam. The theme is "Rewind".

# Getting Started

## Required software
* Unity Hub and Unity 2019.4.6f1
* Any other software that is for your role

## Opening the project
First, clone the repo to your computer. Then use Unity Hub to add the project.

# Branches
To ease the teamwork, the people who are familiar with git will use branches. For programmers, here is the guide.
- `dev` : OUR master branch
- `feature/name-of-your-feature` : when you are coding a game logic or control related thing
- `asset/name-of-asset` : when you are adding asset to unity with raw files from the art department
- `merging/feature/name-of-your-feature` or `merging/asset/name-of-asset` : when your side branch is ready to get pull requested, start a new branch from dev and make a pull request from your branch to merging. If the merge is successful and doesn't break the game, merging branch is then merged into dev branch
